# Decision Helper

Design of a responsive app that helps you make a decision.  
The digital equivalent of a glass ball and a fortune teller.  
The app has a defined pool of answers and randomly assigns them to the user's question.  
On the first view, the user asks a question that must be longer than 5 characters, if it meets the condition a button appears to go next.  
On the second view, the user gets a summary of how his question sounds and can confirm the question or ask another one.  
If he confirms he is redirected to the next view, if he wants to ask a new one he starts all over again.  
On the third view he receives the answer to the question asked and is given the option to start over or decide again.
